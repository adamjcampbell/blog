After some back and forth on the [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com/) discord I became inspired to write on how I view Spellbooks in Cairn as an exercise.

## Spellbooks

Sometimes the writings of the wise, mad, or holy, begin to brush the edges of fundamental truths. Such feats once bound are often repudiated, an all too common fate for pre-emptive and transformative works. Unable to impress their element upon the consciousness on the world, they turn their nature inward. Well dried glyphs of pigment on organic medium eschew their invariant construction to finally express what could not be heard.

Spellbooks are an expression of once in a lifetime insight into forces beyond knowing. They take on form and effect in line with their cognizance. Anyone may hold and read aloud from the tome. It takes two hands and total concentration to perceive order from the chaos that is the pages. No two will read the same words, and yet in the doing will still become the mediums of miracles.
