  <p>At my &lsquo;jobby job&rsquo; I am fortunate enough to have made not one but two <em>File -&gt; New Project</em> iOS apps targeting modern iOS with Swift 6. We test and iterate fairly quickly on these tool-like applications. Risk of deployment of these apps is also low due to them being internal. In this vein I have been searching for a lightweight and fast way to make these applications robustly.</p>

<p>I have felt moderately strongly since using SwiftUI in anger that what Apple defined as a <code>View</code> in SwiftUI does not closely align with what we used to think of as a view. To contrast we can look at the definitions from Apple&rsquo;s own documentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>SwiftUI - View</p>
<p>A type that represents part of your app’s user interface and provides modifiers that you use to configure views.
<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/view">Source</a></p></blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>UIKit - UIView</p>
<p>An object that manages the content for a rectangular area on the screen.
